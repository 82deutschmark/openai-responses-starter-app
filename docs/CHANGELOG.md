### CRITICAL MISDIRECTION - 2025-05-11 (Late Evening)
- **MAJOR ERROR BY CASCADE (AI ASSISTANT):** Throughout the recent refactoring efforts (primarily on 2025-05-11), Cascade operated under the incorrect assumption that the project was targeting the standard OpenAI Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`). 
- **PROJECT GOAL MISUNDERSTOOD:** The project's `README.md` clearly states it is built on top of the "[Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)", described by the USER as a new and different API from Chat Completions for May 2025.
- **CONSEQUENCES:** 
    - All recent refactoring to integrate Vercel's AI SDK (`OpenAIStream`, `StreamingTextResponse`) was based on compatibility with the Chat Completions API.
    - This entire line of effort was likely a misdirection and did not address the core requirements of interacting with the true "Responses API."
    - Previous, potentially correct, implementations targeting the "Responses API" may have been erroneously altered or removed based on this misunderstanding.
- **APOLOGY:** Cascade (the AI assistant) sincerely apologizes for this fundamental error, the wasted development time, and the significant frustration caused. This note serves to inform future developers of this critical context.

### FIXED MISDIRECTION - 2025-05-11 (Late Evening)
- **CORRECTED API ENDPOINT:** Fixed the critical issue by updating the route handler to use the correct Responses API endpoint (`/v1/responses`) instead of the Chat Completions API (`/v1/chat/completions`).
- **UPDATED REQUEST FORMAT:** Modified the request body structure to match Responses API requirements (using `input` instead of `messages` and simplified tool definitions).
- **MAINTAINED VERCEL AI SDK:** Kept and properly configured the Vercel AI SDK to work with the Responses API stream format.
- **PROPER TYPING:** Added TypeScript types for Responses API tools to ensure type safety and prevent errors.
- **ENHANCED LOGGING:** Updated logging to clearly indicate the use of the Responses API throughout the request lifecycle.

### ADDITIONAL FIX - 2025-05-11 (11:08 PM)
- **FIXED REQUIRED PARAMETER:** Added the required `vector_store_ids` parameter to the `file_search` tool, as the Responses API requires this parameter.
- **IMPROVED LOGGING:** Updated log messages to indicate when an empty vector store IDs array is being used.

### CRITICAL FIX - 2025-05-11 (11:19 PM)
- **PROPER TOOLS HANDLING:** Fixed the `file_search` tool implementation based on OpenAI documentation - discovered that `vector_store_ids` must be a non-empty array containing at least one valid vector store ID.
- **CONDITIONAL TOOLS INCLUSION:** Changed code to only include the `file_search` tool when a valid vector store ID is available, completely omitting it otherwise.
- **FIXED TYPE DEFINITIONS:** Updated TypeScript types to correctly represent the API requirements where `vector_store_ids` is a required field that must contain at least one valid ID.

### BUILD FIX - 2025-05-11 (11:25 PM)
- **ESLINT FIX:** Changed `let toolsForResponses` to `const toolsForResponses` to resolve ESLint error during build, as the variable is only modified with array operations (push) and never reassigned.

### Planned Changes
- TBD based on specific requirements
